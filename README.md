# ControllersAndActions
Examples and explanations on how controllers are built and used in Asp.Net Core MVC.

Focus is on the controller files. Starting with POCO controllers -- which are controllers built manually without the help of the 
controller class. Then in the home controller files -- controllers starts with the most labor intensiveexamples --  manually built
controllers, where data is parsed the context data properties of the controller class to give the action method the data it needs.
Each successive controller starts to encapulate more and more code into convieient action methods where the details are hidden away
and the implementation is simplified.
